Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites

clone

git clone https://github.com/jihwankim97/electron-monacoEditor.git
```

npm
```bash
$ npm install
```
Prerequisites
Before running node-pty in your Electron app, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: It's essential to use a version of Node.js that is compatible with your Electron version. You can find this information in the Electron documentation for your specific version.

npm or yarn: These are Node.js package managers. You will need one of them to install node-pty and other dependencies.

Python: node-pty uses node-gyp for native builds, which requires Python. Make sure you have Python version 2.7, or 3.5–3.8 installed. Later versions might not be compatible with node-gyp.

A C++ compiler toolchain: node-pty contains native code that needs to be compiled. On Windows, this could be Visual Studio Build Tools. On macOS and Linux, this is typically GCC or Clang. If you are on a Mac, the easiest way to get these tools is by installing Xcode Command Line Tools by running xcode-select --install in the terminal.

After ensuring that these prerequisites are in place, you can proceed with the installation and running of node-pty within your Electron application.

electron-rebuild
```bash
.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd
```
If the command .\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd does not work, please refer to https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/using-native-node-modules for guidance.

start
```bash
npm start
```
